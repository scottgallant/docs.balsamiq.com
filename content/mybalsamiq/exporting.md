## Exporting to PDF

Unlike the [Desktop version](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/111730#exportpdf), exporting to PDF from myBalsamiq is done outside of the [Editor](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/1366973).

To export to PDF in myBalsamiq, go to the **[Project page](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/112399)** for the mockups you want to export and click the **arrow next to the Edit button** as shown below.

You will see an option listed there to **export to PDF**. When you select it you will be presented with some options and when you click the "Export to PDF" button the file will be created for you to download.

**Note:** You can also export a project to PDF from the context menu on the [All Projects (a.k.a. Home) page](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/112398) in myBalsamiq.

## Exporting to PNG Images

Unlike the [Desktop version](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/111730#exportimage), exporting to a PNG image from myBalsamiq is done outside of the [Editor](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/1366973).

To export to a PNG image in myBalsamiq, go to the **[Single Mockup page](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/112401)** for the mockup you want to export and click the **link below the mockup labeled "Download Image"** as shown below.

The image will then be downloaded to your computer or it will open in a new browser window for you to save by right-clicking on it.
