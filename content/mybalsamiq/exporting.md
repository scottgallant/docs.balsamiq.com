## Exporting to PDF

Unlike the Desktop version, exporting to PDF from myBalsamiq is done outside of the [Editor](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/1366973).

You will see an option listed there to **export to PDF**. When you select it you will be presented with some options and when you click the "Export to PDF" button the file will be created for you to download.
