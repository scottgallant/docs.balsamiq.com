## A Note About Roles and Access 

Many features of myBalsamiq are role-specific. Many of the instructions in this documentation are dependent upon permissions.

Project Members and Anonymous users will not have access to the same features as Staff members.

A few things to note:

*   Only Site Owners have access to [Site Settings](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/112406#sitesettings).
*   Only Staff Members have access to the Project management mentioned in the [Projects](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/112399) section.
*   Anonymous users have the lowest level of access.

See the [Setting Access Control](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/112399#settingaccesscontrol) section of projects for more information about project-level permissions, and see the [myBalsamiq Access Control Matrix](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/229097) for all the details.
