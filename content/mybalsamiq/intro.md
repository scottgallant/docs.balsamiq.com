## A Note about Roles and Access

Many features of myBalsamiq are role-specific. Many of the instructions in this documentation are dependent upon permissions.

Project Members and Anonymous users will not have access to the same features as Staff members.

A few things to note:

*   Only site owners have access to [Site Settings](/mybalsamiq/sitesettings/).
*   Only staff members have access to the Project management mentioned in the [Projects](/mybalsamiq/project/) section.
*   Anonymous users have the lowest level of access.

See the [Setting Access Control](/mybalsamiq/project/#setting-access-control) section of projects for more information about project-level permissions, and see the [myBalsamiq Access Control Matrix](/mybalsamiq/accesscontrolmatrix/) for all the details.
