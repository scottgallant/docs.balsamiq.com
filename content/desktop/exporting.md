The Export menu contains the following export options:

Read on for descriptions of each.

#### Exporting to PDF

You can export the mockups in your project as a PDF, which can be useful for sending by email, presenting to clients, or posting online. If your mockups contain links, these will work in your exported PDF as well, which will allow you to create click-through prototypes of your designs. _(To learn more about linking, see [Linking Mockups Together](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/111742).)_

**Note:** To export to PDF in **myBalsamiq**, see [Managing Projects](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/112399#managingproject) in the myBalsamiq Documentation.

To export to PDF select the Project > Export > Project to PDF... menu command. Each individual mockup will be displayed on a separate page of a PDF document. The mockups will be in the same order as in the project, so arrange them in the order you'd like before exporting.

The PDF export options are shown here.

After exporting, a notification window will appear to show you where your PDF was saved. Click the notification to open the containing folder.

#### Exporting to an image

To save your mockups or project as image files choose one of the export to PNG commands from the Export menu. Export > Mockup to PNG... will save the selected mockup in PNG image format, while Export > Project to PNGs... will save all of the mockups in your project as separate image files.

The shortcuts for exporting a mockup and project to image files are CTRL/CMD+R and CTRL/CMD+Shift+R, respectively.

You can also export a subset of the controls in your mockup by selecting them on the canvas and using the Export Mockup to PNG command. The export dialog will ask you if you want to export only the selected controls or the entire mockup.

#### Printing

To print the selected mockup, go to Project > Print or use the keyboard shortcut CTRL+P (CMD+P on the Mac).

**Note:** Mockups automatically sets a top and left margin on your printed documents using an algorithm based on the dimensions of your mockup, but you may want to set a margin manually. When you're presented with the page setup dialog, you may set a margin for the printer of your choice if the printer driver on your operating system allows you to.

#### Exporting mockups to another project

You can quickly copy mockups from one project to another using the Import/Export Mockup JSON commands in the Project menu. Exporting to Mockups JSON (Project > Export > Mockup to JSON) will copy the Balsamiq Mockups code for the selected mockup to the clipboard. To create this mockup in a new project switch to it and choose “Import Mockup JSON…” from the Project > Import menu and paste the copied code.

#### Exporting for use in a previous version

You can also export your project for use in a previous version of Balsamiq Mockups or version that doesn't yet support the [new BMPR file format](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/1844131#projects).

Selecting Export > Project to BMMLs ZIP... will save your mockups as a ZIP file containing individual BMML files (compatible with Balsamiq Mockups version 2) and images and Symbols stored in an assets sub-folder. You can then upload this file to myBalsamiq or unzip it and open the mockups with an older version of Balsamiq Mockups.

**Note:** This is also how you would export your mockups for use with Balsamiq Mockups for Confluence or JIRA. [Detailed instructions are here](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/721932).

#### Exporting for use in Balsamiq Mockups for Google Drive

If you use Balsamiq Mockups for Google Drive you may notice that it also uses a .bmpr file extension, however it can't open Balsamiq Mockups 3 projects directly (yet).

To open a file created in Balsamiq Mockups 3 for Desktop select "Export > Project to BMMLs ZIP..." in Balsamiq Mockups 3 for Desktop. Then upload this file to Balsamiq Mockups for Google Drive and go to "Project > Import Project from ZIP..." to open it, as described [here](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/1559682#importfromzip).
